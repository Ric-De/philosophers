FIXING. Need to build a validation for must_eat_count = 0 in my parsing.c file before 

/* Add something like this and add a debug line to be sure Validate must_eat_count is not 0 */
	if (argc == 6 && data->must_eat_count == 0)
	{
		printf("Error: ....");
		return (0);
	}

🧪 EDGE CASES TEST SUITE
Here are all the critical edge cases you need to test:

1. SINGLE PHILOSOPHER (Must Die)
bash./philo 1 800 200 200
Expected: Philosopher takes 1 fork, waits forever, dies at ~800ms

2. SINGLE PHILOSOPHER WITH MEAL COUNT
bash./philo 1 800 200 200 5
Expected: Same as above - dies at ~800ms (can't eat with only 1 fork)

3. TWO PHILOSOPHERS (Should Never Die)
bash./philo 2 800 200 200
Expected: Run forever alternating eating (Ctrl+C after ~10 seconds to verify)

4. IMPOSSIBLE TIMING (Guaranteed Death)
bash./philo 4 310 200 100
Expected: Someone dies around 310-320ms (time_to_die = 310, eat+sleep = 300, too tight!)

5. VERY TIGHT TIMING (Borderline)
bash./philo 4 410 200 200
Expected: Might survive or might die - depends on scheduling

6. SAFE TIMING (Should Never Die)
bash./philo 5 800 200 200
Expected: Run forever without deaths (Ctrl+C after ~10 seconds)

7. LARGE NUMBER OF PHILOSOPHERS
bash./philo 200 800 200 200
Expected: All 200 philosophers should run without deaths (Ctrl+C after ~5 seconds)

8. STRESS TEST - Many Philos with Meal Count
bash./philo 200 800 200 200 50
Expected: Should stop after all 200 ate 50 times (might take 30-60 seconds)

9. MINIMAL MEAL COUNT
bash./philo 5 800 200 200 1
Expected: Stops immediately after all ate 1 time (~1 second)

10. ODD NUMBER OF PHILOSOPHERS
bash./philo 5 800 200 200 10
Expected: Should stop after all ate 10 times (odd numbers are tricky for fork distribution)

11. EVEN NUMBER OF PHILOSOPHERS
bash./philo 4 800 200 200 10
Expected: Should stop after all ate 10 times

12. THREE PHILOSOPHERS (Classic Case)
bash./philo 3 610 200 200
Expected: Should run forever without deaths

13. DEATH DETECTION TIMING PRECISION
bash./philo 4 400 200 200
Expected: Run for a while, death should be detected within 10ms of actual death time

14. INVALID ARGUMENTS (Should Print Error)
bash./philo 0 800 200 200
./philo -5 800 200 200
./philo 5 -800 200 200
./philo 5 800 0 200
./philo abc 800 200 200
./philo 5
./philo 5 800 200
Expected: Error message + program exits (no crash!)

15. VALGRIND MEMORY CHECK
bashvalgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all ./philo 4 800 200 200 5
Expected:

"All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible"
Some "possibly lost" from pthread is OK (system allocations)


16. THREAD SANITIZER (Race Condition Check)
bash# First, recompile with thread sanitizer:
make fclean
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pthread -fsanitize=thread -g *.c -I includes -o philo

# Then test:
./philo 4 800 200 200 5
Expected: No data race warnings

📋 QUICK TEST SCRIPT
You can create a test script to run them all:
bash#!/bin/bash
echo "=== Test 1: Single Philosopher ==="
timeout 2 ./philo 1 800 200 200

echo -e "\n=== Test 2: Two Philosophers ==="
timeout 5 ./philo 2 800 200 200

echo -e "\n=== Test 3: Death Case ==="
timeout 2 ./philo 4 310 200 100

echo -e "\n=== Test 4: Meal Count Stop ==="
./philo 4 800 200 200 7

echo -e "\n=== Test 5: Large Number ==="
timeout 5 ./philo 200 800 200 200

echo -e "\n=== Test 6: Invalid Input ==="
./philo 0 800 200 200
./philo abc 800 200 200

echo -e "\n=== All Tests Complete ==="

🎯 MOST CRITICAL TESTS:

✅ Test 1 (1 philo - must die)
✅ Test 4 (meal count stop)
✅ Test 3 (impossible timing - must die)
✅ Test 7 (200 philos - stress test)
✅ Test 15 (valgrind - no leaks)
