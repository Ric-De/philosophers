Files needing refactorization



utils.c OK

routine.c OK

cleanup.c OK

parsing.c -> 3 functions. BUT, parse_arguments() is huge need to split in 2 or 3
		
		Solution: create helper file!! to throw the other 2 functions
		and inside parsing.c leave 3 new parsing functions connected

monitor.c -> 4 functions. BUT, check_death() and check_all_ate() are bigger
		 than 25 lines.
		
		Solution: create a helper file to receive some functions.

main.c -> 1 large function.
		
		Solution: split it in 3 cool functions

init.c -> 4 functions. BUT, 1 is bigger than 25 lines.
		
		Solution: split this crap in 2 functions and leave in the same file.

actions.c -> 5 functions. BUT, take_forks() is bigger than 25 lines

		Solution: create a helper file and split this shit.
